QuarkslaB Dynamic binary Instrumentation (QBDI) is a custom, tailored, cross platform and cross architecture DBI framework. It aims to support Linux, macOS, Android, iOS and Windows operating systems running on X86, X86_64, ARM and AArch64 architectures.

QBDI is still in development. It provides an engine able to execute arbitrary assembly code, and to insert instrumentation before and after instructions.

The x86-64 and x86 support is quite good. The ARM and AARCH64 support are still young and may be unstable.
